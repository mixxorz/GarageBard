## Why

I find that hearing other players make music in-game adds to the atmosphere and
sense of community of the game. With GarageBard, I hope you'll be able to make
the game world feel more alive.

Plus [BardMusicPlayer](https://bardmusicplayer.com/) is Windows only, but I play
on a MacBook... so I made this instead.

## How does it work?

You load up MIDI files and GarageBard "plays" them by sending keystrokes to the game.

## Usage

### Perform/Listen modes

You can swap between Perform and Listen modes depending on what you want to do:

- **Perform**: Send keystrokes to play the song
- **Listen**: Listen to the song using GarageBard's synthesizer

### Transpose out of range notes

When this is turned on, notes that fall outside what's playable in the game are
automatically transposed up or down to fit within the range of what's playable.

You will have to queue the song again once you make this change.

### Arpeggiate chords

When this is turned on, all chords will automatically be arpeggiated, so they
sound better. Generally, you will want this on.

You will have to queue the song again once you make this change.

### Overlay mode

When enabled, GarageBard will stay on top of the game so that it's always
visible.

## Troubleshooting

**GarageBard needs Accessibility access in order to send keystrokes to Final Fantasy XIV.**

GarageBard works by sending keystrokes to the game process. In order to do this,
the app needs to have Accessibility permissions.

To grant GarageBard permissions, click on the message then click "Open System
Preferences" on the dialog that pops up. In the System Preferences window that
opens, click the lock on the bottom left of the window to unlock the settings.
Tick the checkbox next to GarageBard in the list of apps under Accessibility.
Finally, close System Preferences.

You know you've done this correctly when the message disappears from GarageBard.

**Can't find game instance. Is the game running?**

This message means that GarageBard was unable to find the game process. When
this happens, the app falls back to sending keystrokes to _any_ app that is in
the foreground.

If the game _is_ running but you still see this message, it can still work
as long as you have the game focused.

If you have time, please [open an issue](https://github.com/mixxorz/GarageBard/issues/new)
so I can make the process detection better.

**Some notes are out of range**

This message means that there are some notes on the selected track of the
current song that fall beyond the range of what can be played in the game. When
GarageBard encounters these notes, it simply ignores them.

The only way to fix this issue is to manually tweak the song using a MIDI editor
so that none of the notes fall below C2 and above C5.
